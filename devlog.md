### Right now I am planning on how I should go about doing this program and looking at the python programs given as references to what I need to do and looking at the sample output.Using python, I'm thinking the project will be one python file that will contain multiple methods. Thats all I know for now

### The program will consist of about 3 methods, we will have the main method, a method for customer, and a method for teller. I am going to start probably with creating customer queue, shared resources, global counter, and teller management variables to be used in all methods and start working on the main method and outline both the customer and teller methods along the way
